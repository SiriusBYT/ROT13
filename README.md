# this is a poorly made ROT13 thingy
the only reason I made this is because I wanted to write C but I was forced to be in a bad online computer science class, shit asked me doing some encrypting shit so I did but instead of doing the simple way and going to an already existing web tool to do what this terrible program does, i decided to C myself dig deeper into this segfault rabbit hole.

update: in the end in the exercice I DO have to make a program to do this, but i did it in C instead of python because fuck myself
